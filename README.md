Firefox add-on to quickly save a selection of tabs. These can be ones that are marked with the cursor or selected through search terms, or simply every tab that's currently open.

There will be a context menu added when right-clicking on any tab. This context menu has three submenus, the functionality of which should be pretty self-explanatory.

The extension needs HTML modification permissions since it is opening a webpage (I've chosen example.com as a placeholder) and then completely replacing its source with my custom plain list of URLs,

if I find a more elegant way to open and load custom HTML pages from my addon I will happily replace this sketchy looking permission.
